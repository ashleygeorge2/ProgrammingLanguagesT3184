In this project c++ and java were combined to create a chip technology in order to track zoo animals. As ordered to create a POC project to test that system integration and design that deliver what they require. By combining C++ code that links to a Java class using JNI. Creating a file that collects and saves data over a specific animal. Providing a user menu, animal data provided, what type of species the animal is, the tracking number, the sub-type of the animal, number of eggs that were laid (if Oviparous), and if the animal was nursing or not. While this data could be added, or deleted, plus saved once provided. Then applying the data into a column chart for display. 

In the place I did particularly well was creating the different functions and classes of data base for the name, tracking number, animal type, the subtype of the animal, egg number, and nurse. Along with creating the function for the column display.

In the load data set file, I could have tried different functions to process. Such as instead of using a if, else possible use a try and catch. By applying different outlooks to the code, I could provide better improvemnets to how the code will run and have it running more effeciently. 

Although I did have a hard time with any of the code challenge, I did come across quite a few errors that ended up having to rewritten or different functions being used. Once I was able to find the errors or syntax errors, I was able to locate where the error was located without having to change the whole code By finding the syntax errors first and fixing them, it then provided the unresolved errors that needed to be fixed or was not programmed in the code. I will be further studying what I have learned, plus the materail provided through the term to better my understand and coding skills.  

From learning over how C++ works and what is needed to be applied to create a realiable code. I can use what I have learned, like the the switch case. Makes it a lot easier to combine different actions in one function. Void and classes keep the main file neater and less cluttered by just calling that class out. 

By adding comments in different sections of the code to apply what that class was directed towards or why the functions was being used. Trasintioning the code from one branch to the next.
